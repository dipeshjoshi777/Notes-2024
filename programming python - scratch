Python has several built-in data types for storing different kinds of information in variables. Following are some commonly used data types:
Integer
Float
Boolean
None
String
List
Tuple
Dictionary

Integer, float, boolean, None, and string are primitive data types because they represent a single value. 
Other data types like list, tuple, and dictionary are often called data structures or containers because they hold multiple pieces of data together.
Integers represent positive or negative whole numbers, from negative infinity to infinity. 
Note that integers should not include decimal points. Integers have the type int.

Floats (or floating-point numbers) are numbers with a decimal point. 
There are no limits on the value or the number of digits before or after the decimal point. Floating-point numbers have the type float. eg PI
whole number is treated as a float if written with a decimal point, even though the decimal portion of the number is zero
While performing arithmetic operations, integers are automatically converted to floats if any of the operands is a float. 
Also, the division operator / always returns a float, even if both operands are integers. 
Use the // operator if you want the result of the division to be an int

Booleans represent one of 2 values: True and False. Booleans have the type bool
automatically converted to ints when used in arithmetic operations. True is converted to 1 and False is converted to 0

The None type includes a single value None, used to indicate the absence of a value. None has the type NoneType. 
It is often used to declare a variable whose value may be assigned later.
nothing = None  

A string is used to represent text (a string of characters) in Python. Strings must be surrounded using quotations (either the single quote ' or the double quote "). 
strings have the type string. You can check the length of a string using the len function. len(string) also print(string) and \n for spaces
Strings also support several list operations, which are discussed in the next section. We'll look at a couple of examples here.
You can access individual characters within a string using the [] indexing notation. 
Note the character indices go from 0 to n-1, where n is the length of the string.
today = "saturday night"
today[5:11] 'day ni'
You can also check whether a string contains a some text using the in operator.
'day' in today Two or more strings can be joined or concatenated using the + operator. use "" to add spaces
The string.replace method replaces a part of the string with another string. Note that replace returns a new string, and the original string is not modified.

The .split method splits a string into a list of strings at every occurrence of provided character(s).
he .strip method removes whitespace characters from the beginning and end of a string.

A list in Python is an ordered collection of values. Lists can hold values of different data types and support operations to add, remove, and change values. 
Lists have the type list. To create a list, enclose a sequence of values within square brackets [ and ], separated by commas.
use len(list_name) to find length and just type list_name to print
use list_name[1] to select the element in the list start of list being [0] and for end of list access use negative indices [-1]

You can also change the value at a specific index within a list using the assignment operation.
To remove an element from a specific index, use the pop method. fruits.insert(0, 'banana') to add elements



A tuple is an ordered collection of values, similar to a list. Tuple is an immutable list and no values can be added
Tuples are often used to create multiple variables with a single statement.Tuples have just two built-in methods: count and index


A dictionary is an unordered collection of items. Each item stored in a dictionary has a key and value. 
You can use a key to retrieve the corresponding value from the dictionary. Dictionaries have the type dict.
Dictionaries are often used to store many pieces of information e.g. details about a person, in a single variable. 
Dictionaries are created by enclosing key-value pairs within braces or curly brackets { and }.
Dictionaries can also be created using the dict function.
person2 = dict(name='Jane Judy', sex='Female', age=28, married=False)
Keys can be used to access values using square brackets [ and ]. person2['name'] >> can also use the get method to access the value associated with a key.
Dictionaries also provide methods to view the list of keys, values, or key-value pairs inside it.
